BUILD on Linux

If you want to build CHM Reader, please download gecko-sdk from

  ftp://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.9.0.5/sdk/

Extract it and set GECKO_SDK variable to the directory of it.


BUILD on FreeBSD

There's no prebuild xulrunner sdk for FreeBSD and XULRunner 1.9.0.x is still
not included in FreeBSD ports too. We can build a SDK from source code, but
that's waste lots of time.

We can use headers and libiaries in firefox3 package to build chmfox.
Since no xpidl provided with firefox3 package, the header and xpt file
generation is disabled by default on FreeBSD.
